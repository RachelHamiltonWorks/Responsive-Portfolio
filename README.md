Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework I created a mobile responsive personal portfolio, which will be updated with future projects.

For the portfolio I:

- Employed Boostrap's grid system
- Implemented a responsive navbar, layout, and images
- Ensured that the code minimized the use of media queries, and that the semantic HTML was valid 

Look for many commits and updates to my work!
